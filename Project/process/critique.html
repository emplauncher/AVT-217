<h1>Portfolio Site Critiques</h1>
	
<img src="ddlombardi.png" alt="d. dominick lombardi portfolio site" height= "500">
	<a href="https://www.ddlombardi.com/"> <h2>D. Dominick Lombardi</h2></a>
	<p>This site is an extremely well organized archive of everything Lombardi has created, from the beginning of his career to present day, yet remains simple and easy to navigate. It also contains links to publications he has written for and places he has shown at. It is a bit plain and has lots of negative space, but overall does its job well.<br></br></p>

<img src="magsmunroe.png" alt="mags munroe portfolio site" height= "500">
	<a href="http://www.magsmunroe.com/"> <h2>Mags Munroe</h2></a>
	<p>This site remains clear and fairly inuitive, while still showcasing Munroe's personailty with a great color scheme and a fun animated logo. The images on the homepage double as links to more pictures of and information about each piece or project. The about page provides plenty of information about where to find Munroe on social media, and her past experience, as well as links to previous collaborations. <br></br></p>

<img src="micahulrich.png" alt="micah ulrich portfolio site" height= "500">
	<a href="https://www.micahulrichart.com/"> <h2>Micah Ulrich</h2></a>
	<p>This site is immediately recognizable as Ulrich's style, right down to the color scheme, font choices, and menu names, but it doesn't come across as forced or pretentious. The menu names are original and creative, but still make sense, and it's easy to navigate. The store redirects to the website where Ulrich sells his merchandise, so the storefront doesn't distract from the portfolio site.<br></br></p>

<img src="zacjackson.png" alt="zac jackson portfolio site" height= "500">
	<a href="https://www.zacjackson.com/"> <h2>Zac Jackson</h2></a>
	<p>This site is extremely intuitive and clear, with a good color scheme that serves to enhance the art displayed. The viewer's immediate focus is drawn to the artwork, and clicking the images provides more details on each piece. The about page and the artist's statement page contain clear information and provide more context to the ethos and thought process behind each piece.<br></br></p>

<img src="gabrielpicolo.png" alt="gabriel picolo portfolio site" height= "500">
	<a href="https://www.gabrielpicolo.com/"> <h2>Gabriel Picolo</h2></a>
	<p>This final site of our critique is simple, intuitive, and informative all at once. All of Picolo's work is divided among several categories, making it easy to differentiate between different projects. Each piece or project is displayed with no need to click for more information, as the captions to each image contain all of the information necessary. The site also manages to maintain some of Picolo's personality, without sacrificing professionalism. <br></br></p>
